# paleoproxies
This is the hosting page for the repository for the pages of the proxy handbook. This project, begun during a research scholar stay at CAU Kiel, attempts to consolidate the most up-to-date information about the widest transect of paleoproxies available. 

The purpose of this project is to be clear, readable, and updateable as more information comes out about various proxies in use. If you have any comments, concerns, or questions, please feel free to reach out to me at cassandra.bartels@whoi.edu! I am always looking for collaborators and assistance, so if you have some thoughts and some free time, I would most heartily welcome it!
